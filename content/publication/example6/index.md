abstract: Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of male reproductive health. In recent years, with the development of computer industry, more and more effective algorithms and techniques have been applied in this field to help CASA obtain more objective and quantitative analysis results rapidly. As target detection is an important part in image processing which is the basic technique of CASA and also includes pre-processing, feature extraction and tracking, this survey comprehensively analyses studies focus on target detection in CASA since 1988.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A comprehensive review of computer assisted sperm analysis system.
