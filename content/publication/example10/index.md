abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization and living standards, microorganisms play an increasingly important role in industrial production, bio-technique, and food safety testing. Microorganism biovolume measurements are one of the essential parts of microbial analysis. However, traditional manual measurement methods are time-consuming and challenging to measure the characteristics precisely. With the development of digital image processing techniques, the characteristics of the microbial population can be detected and quantified. The applications of the microorganism biovolume measurement method have developed since the 1980s. More than 62 articles are reviewed in this study, and the articles are grouped by digital image analysis methods with time. This study has high research significance and application value, which can be referred to as microbial researchers to comprehensively understand microorganism biovolume measurements using digital image analysis methods and potential applications.
