abstract: SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of wide contagion and quick propagation velocity. To analyse the visual information of it, we build a SARS-CoV-2 Microscopic Image Dataset (SC2-MID) with 48 electron microscopic images and also prepare their ground truth images. Furthermore, we extract multiple classical features and novel deep learning features to describe the visual information of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, it is proved that the visual features of the SARS-CoV-2 images which are observed under the electron microscopic can be extracted and analysed.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Propose a dataset of SARS-CoV-2 with the corresponding Ground Truth.
